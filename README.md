# AI Safety Incident Log

A comprehensive system for tracking, managing, and analyzing AI safety incidents. This application provides a robust API for logging and monitoring incidents related to AI systems, helping organizations maintain better oversight of AI safety concerns.

## Features

- **Incident Management**
  - Create, read, update, and delete incidents
  - Track incident severity, status, and categories
  - Add detailed information including impact scope and affected systems
  - Tag incidents for better organization
  - Track resolution notes and prevention measures

- **User Authentication & Authorization**
  - Secure user authentication
  - Role-based access control (Admin and regular users)
  - JWT-based authentication
  - Password hashing and security

- **Advanced Search & Filtering**
  - Search incidents by title, description, or tags
  - Filter by severity, status, or category
  - Pagination support for large datasets
  - Full-text search capabilities

- **Statistics & Analytics**
  - Incident statistics dashboard
  - Severity distribution analysis
  - Category-based incident tracking
  - Status tracking and resolution metrics

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python/Flask
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Testing**: Python unittest

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- MySQL 5.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Safety-Incident-Log.git
cd AI-Safety-Incident-Log
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
# Flask configuration
FLASK_APP=run.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production

# Database configuration
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=ai_safety_log

# JWT configuration
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-key-change-this-in-production
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES=3600  # 1 hour in seconds
```

5. Initialize the database:
```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the application:
```bash
python run.py
```

2. The application will:
   - Create necessary database tables
   - Create an admin user (username: admin, password: admin123)
   - Populate sample data
   - Start the server on http://localhost:5000

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/login` - Login and get JWT token
- `POST /auth/register` - Register new user

### Incidents
- `GET /incidents` - Get all incidents (with pagination)
- `POST /incidents` - Create new incident
- `GET /incidents/{id}` - Get specific incident
- `PUT /incidents/{id}` - Update incident
- `DELETE /incidents/{id}` - Delete incident
- `GET /incidents/search` - Search incidents
- `GET /incidents/stats` - Get incident statistics

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_api.py
```

## Security Features

- Password hashing using Werkzeug
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting
- SQL injection prevention
- Environment variable-based configuration
- Secure password storage
- Database credentials protection

## Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` file to version control
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Use different credentials for development and production

2. **Database Security**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Limit database user permissions
   - Enable SSL for database connections
   - Regular security audits

3. **Application Security**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Regular security testing
